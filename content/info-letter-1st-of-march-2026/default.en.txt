**Dear go players, liebe Go Spielende**,

the **Zurich Spring Tournament** will be held on Saturday and Sunday, June 20th and 21st. It's at the same location as last year, in GZ Buchegg in the Spiegelsaal, if the weather is good we can also play outside.

You can already register:

**Hwang In-seong** will be at the tournament as teacher, referee, reviewer and mentor. He will also do a **workshop** on Friday evening 19th June.

There is a plan to organize the **swiss championship** this year together with Hanspeter Schmid from Brugg/Windisch basically the same setup as in 2024, it's not decided yet and we don't yet have a date.

In October (around 26.-28.) **Cho Seok-bin** will come for a workshop, please enter it in your calendar if you are interested.

As you know we are present at some major **festivals and events** to teach the rules and also make bit promotion for our game. This year for the first time we will go to the **Japan Food Festival**, we will have a stand and give a 1 hour workshop in the afternoon. It's on  3. - 5. April (link: https://www.japanfoodfest.ch/ text: https://www.japanfoodfest.ch/). We will also be at the **Popcon** as the last 3 years, it's from 26. - 27. September (link: https://zurichpopcon.ch/ text: https://zurichpopcon.ch/) and together with the swiss go federation we will be in Bern at the **Hero Fest** 2. - 4. October. It's just one week after Popcon. (link: https://herofest.ch/ text: https://herofest.ch/) they are quite a bit less commercial than Popcon and almost same size. If you are interested to help please drop me a line. It's quite an effort to do that but i think it's beneficial to do some public work! To me it's important that go is not only present in the club but also publicly so people take notice that we exist (and might start to play the game themselves?!)

Our **annual membership fee** is 100 Fr for full members and 50 Fr for students, seniors, and others with limited income. First-year members pay half price.

One advantage of being member is that you can go to other tournaments and play for "Zurich Go Club" and you also get a discount if you buy go material ((link: https://photos.app.goo.gl/U8JM3KR39eccX7gW7 text: board) / (link: https://photos.app.goo.gl/myBF7eEqeq3PWUGr6 text: stones)) (10 Fr discount) and books (5 Fr discount). Small books are 15 Fr, bigger ones are 20 Fr. We don't have a membership obligation, you can always come and play and if you have friends interested in the game then please just bring them along, everyone is welcome to play!
